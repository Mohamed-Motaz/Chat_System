Assumptions

Issues:
Memory may run out of redis before pushing the changes to the db
Redis is a single point of failure
Workers may die after pulling a job from the queue, so the job may be lost
Uuid token may actually collide with another (0.00001% chance) so it needs to be   handled.
Before accepting a message, I first need to check if the chat is present in redis or the db
A very complex design decision is maintaining the counter. The corner case that drove me nuts is as follows: We have a few go servers running, with the chats_number = 100. The value is currently stored in redis. Redis dies, and then the servers die as well. The only place that knows what the max number is is the db. The go servers are then woken up along with Redis. At this point, Redis doesn’t have a key called chats_number. So the solution is, for every go server, when it encounters a new chat that it hasn’t served before, iT first queries the db for the maximum chats_number. It then attempts to set the key chats_number in Redis to the correct value. After doing so, it calls INCR to get the new number. Here is the race condition: Two servers do the same sequence of events. A server “A” calls MySQL, while the other “B” has called MySQL, set the ctr, and incremented it appropriately. Why did both call MySQL? Because this is the first time both have seen this chat for this app. So they aren’t sure if it is in Redis or not. The issue is that now server “A” attempts to set the ctr to the value it obtained from MySQL. This is wrong, because the ctr has already been set and incremented. This would result in duplicate numbers. So the solution is to use SETNX (if key doesn’t exist, then calling INCR to get the appropriate counter). In essence, whenever a server receives a request to create a chat for the first time for a specific app, or a message for a specific chat for the first time, it has to call MySQL, SETNX the key, and then INCR it to get the correct result.

In the chats table, I chose the foreign key to be on the application_token, rather than the application_id. This was a hard choice. Pros: Only 1 query to get the applications chat. Cons: Indexing a varchar, which means that the index may grow in size quite a bit in the future. Comparing varchars is indeed slower than ints, but if I opt for using the application_id, the first query would still have to compare tokens to use the index. So it makes more sense to decrease the queries sent to the db which may already be under alot of load due to the messages.

When updating an app, I simply perform the update based on the given token, rather than first checking if it exists. The reasoning here is also to decrease the number of round trips to the db, although this comes at the price that the user receives an ugly error when updating an app with an incorrect token.

More bottlenecks: 
  When sending all the numbers to be updated in bulk to the server, we need to make sure that the operation isn't blocking. Thus we use the iterator, rather than load the complete Result in memory which would block.
  When the worker is pulling from the queue, I don't ack until I am finished with the db operations. This is a huge bottleneck and a solution might be to immediately log an entity when receiving from the queue, then immediately ack the queue so I don't block other workers.
